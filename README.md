# Hello, World README

Quick description of a Hello World module for lux.

This is one of the simplest ways to get started writing an extension with lux.


## Usage

To get this package working, we can use this syntax for now

```
lxpkg -i https://luxserver.org/package/hello_world -a <path-to-instance>
```


## More

This extension will create one new route in your app called '/hello'.  When the endpoint is requested, it will simply display "Hello World" in the center of your screen.
